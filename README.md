ErrorsOfCalculatingScores

Program ask the name of the file that contains the information of the scores.
Program tries to open the file and read the file and if it can't do it,
an error will be printed. Otherwise goes through the file and if the file
contains a line that doesn't consist of two strings separated by (a) space
character(s), the program prints an error message. The file will be processed
line by line from the beginning towards the end. The program will print the
error message related to the first error it finds. The execution of the program
will end immediately after printing the first error message. This means, that if
there are multiple errors in the file, only the first one will be reported.
The program helps you add up the scores that various contestants have obtained
in a game. The scores are stored in a text file that the program uses as input.
The scores can be entered to the file in practically any order, and the program
does not even take a stand on how many scores each contestant gets. The only
operations the program performs are the calculation of the sum of scores of the
contestants with the same name and printing the scores of all the contestants in
alphabetical order, according to the player's name.
